# MatConvNet: CNNs for MATLAB

**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit
the [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.

---------------------

This branch is deprecated, as there is an official `vl_dagnn.m` in vlfeat/matconvnet. The code has been moved to [MatConvDAG](https://github.com/pengsun/MatConvDAG) and made a standalone project that keeps updating with vlfeat/matconvnet but addresses a slightly different problem domain.
