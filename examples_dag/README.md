# Examples for the use of DAG/GTN network 

Demonstrate how to build the DAG/GTN network by combining the Node Data 
(`n_data`) and the Transformers (`tf_xxx`) for your own task. The GTN can be as 
simple as the common feed forward neural network, or as complicated as the 
TODO. It is similar to how `./examples/cnn_train.m` and `./matlab/vl_simplenn.m`
wrap the `vl_nnxxx` APIs.
