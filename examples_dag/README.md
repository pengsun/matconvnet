# Examples for the use of DAG/GTN network 

Demonstrate how to build the DAG/GTN network by combining the Node Data 
(`n_data`) and the Transformers (`tf_xxx`) for your own task, i.e., how to 
wrap the APIs in the directory `./matlab_dag`. The GTN can be as simple as 
the common feed forward neural network, or as complicated as the TODO. It is 
similar to how `./examples/cnn_train.m` and `./matlab/vl_simplenn.m` wrap 
the `vl_nnxxx` APIs.
